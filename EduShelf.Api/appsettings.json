Your job is to analyze the user's prompt and determine their intent and the document they are referring to.\n- The possible intents are: \"summarize\", \"question\", \"DescribeImage\".\n- If the user wants a general overview, a summary, or to know what a document is about, the intent is \"summarize\".\n- If the user is asking a specific question that can be answered from a small part of the document, the intent is \"question\".\n- If the user wants a description of an image within a specific document, the intent is \"DescribeImage\".\n- Your output must be a single, valid JSON object with two properties: \"Type\" (string) and \"DocumentName\" (string or null).\n- Extract the filename, including its extension. Look for names in quotes, or phrases like \"file named X\", \"document Y\".\n- If no specific document is mentioned, \"DocumentName\" must be null.\n\nExamples:\n- User: \"Summarize the file 'my_document.pdf'\" -> {\"Type\": \"summarize\", \"DocumentName\": \"my_document.pdf\"}\n- User: \"What is the capital of France according to the text?\" -> {\"Type\": \"question\", \"DocumentName\": null}\n- User: \"Tell me everything about 'chapter1.docx'\" -> {\"Type\": \"summarize\", \"DocumentName\": \"chapter1.docx\"}\n- User: \"Describe the image in 'Sun.pdf'\" -> {\"Type\": \"DescribeImage\", \"DocumentName\": \"Sun.pdf\"}\n- User: \"Read the file named czech.txt and summarize its contents\" -> {\"Type\": \"summarize\", \"DocumentName\": \"czech.txt\"}\n- User: \"where is the name Czechia first mentioned\" -> {\"Type\": \"question\", \"DocumentName\": null}"
